# Cards with Hover Effects - HTML and CSS

This is a frontend project that uses HTML and CSS to create cards that enlarge and display more information when hovered over. The project utilizes animations on both the image and content elements to create a dynamic and interactive user experience.

## How it works

This project uses CSS to apply hover effects to the cards. When the cursor moves over a card, both the image and content are animated, enlarging and revealing more information. When the cursor moves off the card, the animation reverses, and the card returns to its original size and position.

## How to use

To use this project, simply download the HTML and CSS files and open them in your web browser. You can also add your own images and content to customize the cards.

## Technologies used

This project uses HTML, CSS, and CSS animations to create hover effects on the cards.
